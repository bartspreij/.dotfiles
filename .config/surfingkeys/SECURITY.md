# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a low-risk security vulnerability, please [open an issue](https://github.com/b0o/surfingkeys-conf/issues/new).

To report a medium- to high-risk vulnerability, please email me at `maddy -at- na dot ai`.

Low-risk is loosely defined as a vulnerability that may cause annoyance to the user.

Medium-risk is loosely defined as a vulnerability that may:
- be used to cause a denial of service to the user, their network, or other networks
- require an attacker to have physical access to the user's device

High-risk is loosely defined as a vulnerability that may be exploited by a remote attacker to:
- run arbitrary code on the user's browser or device
- exfiltrate private data from the user's browser or device
- cause data loss or damage to the user's browser or device

These are general guidelines; please use your best intuition to decide how to responsibly disclose any security issue.
